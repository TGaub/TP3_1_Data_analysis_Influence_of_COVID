## About

The emergence and global spread of COVID-19 have had profound impacts on economies and financial markets worldwide. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin, has experienced significant fluctuations, raising questions about the influence of global crises on digital assets. This project seeks to analyze the data from the capital markets and the evolving situations of the COVID-19 pandemic to identify potential correlations and patterns. The analysis will primarily focus on how pandemic-related developments, such as infection rates, governmental responses, vaccine distribution, and economic impacts, may correlate with the behavior of Bitcoin in the capital market.
Utilizing a range of statistical and data analysis methodologies, this project aims to provide a comprehensive examination of these correlations. By employing techniques such as correlation analysis, time series analysis, and advanced predictive models, this study strives to unravel the complexities of this relationship. The insights derived from this research could not only contribute to our understanding of the impact of global health crises on financial markets but also shed light on the resilience and behavior of decentralized digital currencies in the face of such events.
In exploring these themes, this project aims to contribute to the broader discourse on the interplay between health crises and financial markets, offering valuable insights for investors, policymakers, and researchers alike. As the world navigates through the uncharted territories of pandemic management and economic recovery, understanding these dynamics becomes increasingly critical
